## Notes on 3D Printing on Fabric
* set infill to between 15-30%
* Add the Pause at Height script and change the Pause Height to the height above the build plate you wish to pause the print. The height for the first layer is the thickness of the bottom. The second layer would print at the sum of the bottom thickness and the layer height. The printer will pause at the set height before starting to print, therefore in order to pause after two layers have printed, the height must be larger than the height at which the second layer would print.
* 20% infill
* bottom thickness + layer height < pause height
* .75 + .15 = .9 mm
* pause height = 1 mm
